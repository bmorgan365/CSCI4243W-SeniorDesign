## Description
The idea is to enable sharing/renting anything. For example, one perosn with a specialied kitchen gadget that sits rarely used might want to rent it out short-term (ie 3-4 hours). To do so , the renter puts the device in a programmable locker. A rentee who signs up for it then comes to the locker, retrieves the item, uses it, and returns it. The locker is really a generalized version of a bike-share rack. The entire process is handled y an app. Instead of payment in cash, renters could "donate" and receive altruism points for a leaderboard. The technical parts include a combination of Arduino-driven physical construction, a renter-rentee matching algorithm, and a camera inside the locker that verifies proper loan-and-return.

## Substance
This project seeks to improve human environmental footprint by reducing excessive consumerism and enabling sharing within a community. Having less "stuff" is useful in small urban apartments or dorms. 

## Algorithmic
The matching algorithm will need to scale and accommodate all kinds of requests and schedules (ie "I need a cordless drill nect Sunday morning"), including distance traveled to the nearest locker. The camera inside each locker will need enough to recognize objects, with perhaps QR codes attached to the objects.

## Implementation
One part of implementation will be the app and its front-end. Another will involve server development, which will include maching. A third part involves the lovker construction with a camera.
